# Turing.jl: Bayesian inference with probabilistic programming. 

### Intuitive
Turing models are easy to write and communicate â€” syntax is close to mathematical notations. 

### General-purpose
Turing supports models with discrete parameters and stochastic control flow. 

### Modular and composable 
Turing is modular, written entirely in Julia, and is interoperable with the powerful Julia ecosystem.
